## Introduction

The name of this application is Express Sweater Weather. The application allows users to get the current weather and forecast data for a city. Users can also add and remove locations as favorites, and get the current weather forecasts for all of their favorite cities.

Part of this application [was initally made with Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/joshsherwood1/sweater_weather). The goal of this project was to recreate parts of the application using an Express framework instead.
